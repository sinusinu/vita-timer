vita-timer is a mediocre stopwatch/timer homebrew app for PS Vita. Made with no particular reason other than learning about vitasdk.

This is my first C++ program ever, so please be kind to those ugly codes written by a Java maniac.

## Features

* Stopwatch
* Timer (with beep)

## Building

Install vitasdk and run:

```
cmake . && make
```
